# perpustakaan-be

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Express, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Express** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Prisma** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **MySQL** - Database engine

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses MySQL with Prisma.

1. Make sure you have a MySQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your MySQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
pnpm run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
